                 Creating and Modifying a Repository

-> What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository git creates a hidden folder in the directory
to track your files. It does NOT commit until you tell it to, but git does not auto-
matically do a first commit when you initialize.
	Why do you need to do it? Well I suppose so that git can track every change
that takes place in that directory...obviously if it tracked all the changes in your
entire system that wouldnt be of much use.

-> How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is where git prepares the commit for the repository. This provides
a useful extra step for control over what you want to commit, you can chose to only add
certain files, double check to see which files have already been added to commit and which
ones havent.
